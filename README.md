# GraphQL on Express aka GOE

This is a very minimal implementation of GraphQL with ExpressJS and a basic boilerplate to get started with GraphQL.

### Installation

   - Clone the Repo.
   - run 'npm install'
   - run 'node server.js'
   - in new terinal run 'npm run json:server'

### Feature

   - You can use your own endpoint for data instead of json server, which means your own API endpoint to load data.
   - Head start schema for User

You will have screen like that to get start with.
